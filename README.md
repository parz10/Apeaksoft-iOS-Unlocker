Apeaksoft iOS Unlocker is a software tool designed to help iOS users unlock their devices when they are locked out due to forgotten passcodes, disabled screens, or other similar situations. It is compatible with various iOS devices, including iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.

Key features of Apeaksoft iOS Unlocker include:

1. Unlock Screen Passcode: If you have forgotten your device's passcode or entered the wrong passcode too many times, Apeaksoft iOS Unlocker can help you remove the passcode and gain access to your device again.

2. Remove Apple ID: If you have purchased a second-hand iOS device and the previous owner's Apple ID is still linked to it, this tool can remove the Apple ID association, allowing you to use the device with your own Apple ID.

3. Bypass Screen Time Restrictions: If you have enabled Screen Time restrictions on your device and forgotten the passcode, Apeaksoft iOS Unlocker can help you bypass those restrictions without losing any data.

4. Easy-to-use Interface: The software features a user-friendly interface that guides you through the unlocking process step-by-step, making it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.

5. High Success Rate: Apeaksoft iOS Unlocker claims to have a high success rate in unlocking iOS devices, ensuring that you can regain access to your device in most cases.

It's worth noting that using Apeaksoft iOS Unlocker may lead to data loss on your device. Therefore, it is recommended to back up your data regularly to avoid any potential data loss during the unlocking process.

Please remember to use this tool responsibly and only on devices that you own or have proper authorization to unlock.
